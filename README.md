```
* `clear` keyword can be entered inbetween any lines in either of the section above.


## Assumptions
* All matches are taken place in the same year.
* When `clear` is entered in the team information section, it clears all teams' information.
* When `clear` is entered in the match result section, it only clears match information but does not clear team information.
